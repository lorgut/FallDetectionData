# FallDetectionData
Repository which contains the data of falls simulations, the analysis and IoT-TEG generated test events. Moreover, a Java program with an EPL query which detects falls is included (based in an ongoing prototype). Falls and no falls for testing, JSON format, are included in TestData folder.
The videos have been cut from the original ones because the repository does not allow more than 25M.
