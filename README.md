# FallDetectionData
Repository which contains:

* The FAW acceleration fall analysis, ODS format files (FAWPerson{1,2}DataAnalysis.ods).
* The videos in which some of the analysed FAW falls can be watch. The videos have been cut from the original ones because the repository does not allow more than 25M.
* The IoT-TEG testing rules and the final generated FAW falls using the tool (ImprovedPrototypeIoT-TEGGeneratedEvents.ods)
* A Java program with the EPL query, included in the ongoing prototype, which detects falls. 
* Extracted original falls and no falls for testing (JSON format). They are included in TestData folder.
